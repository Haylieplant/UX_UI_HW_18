                  <h4> RWD-Resign of San ANtonio Zoo website</h4> 
                  <p>Our plan for redesign of the San Antonio Zoo website is to help the zoo reach a wider customer base for profit during this pandemic. 
                    We want to make it easier for the user to find information on the Zoo, the covid-19 action plans, and their current activities the Zoo is offering. 
                    We feel by making these changes that it can help the user know what is going on at the zoo and increase the zooâ€™s revenue during covid-19.

                    <h4>The Homeland Security RWD redesign</h4> 
                    <p>
                        I believe the problem with the DHS website is the layout and the amount of information they have on the page, it  can be  very overwhelming,
                         By redesigning the website to  simplify and reduce  the amount of content on a page the user will be able to find the information they need more efficiently.
